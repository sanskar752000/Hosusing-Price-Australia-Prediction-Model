# Housing Price Prediction - Advance Regression
- A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. For the same purpose, the company has collected a data set from the sale of houses in Australia. Determine the optimal value of lambda for ridge and lasso regression.

## General Information
- This project is made to solve a business problem of housing prediction in Australia using a Ridge and Lasso Regression ML model which is created using Python
- This project is based on building Advance Regression model by performing analysis on the dataset.
- The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market. You are required to build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.
- The company wants to know:
    1. Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house, and
    2. How well those variables describe the price of a house.


<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- With Lasso regression we are able to achieve R2 Score of 89.69% on test data which is very similar to Ridge regression. Meaning 89.69% of the variance in test data can be explained by our model.
- Root Mean Square Error on test data is 0.138 means the prediction made by the model is of by 0.138 units which is quite good.
